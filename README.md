The top industry which is being invested in or acquired is the Biotechnology industry with an excess of $361 billion pumped into it. Of course, this is if we ignore the unnamed industry whose name was missing on the dataset. This means that as a start up the right way to go would be the biotech way since it offers more investment opportunities.

2.	How vast is the regional difference between biotechnology acquirers and what percentage of the funds did they raise?
As shown in the pie chart below the top biotechnology acquirers were from the Newark and SF Bay Area regions. This is prime territory for a biotech start up and start ups found in these locations have a higher acquisition chance compared to being in other regions. Therefore a biotech start up should have their base here.

The top investor cities were New York and Tokyo. Any Start ups found in these locations have a higher chance of getting investment since huge amounts of cash, upwards of $216 billion dollars are invested into start ups. There Start ups should aim to have these cities as a base of operations.
